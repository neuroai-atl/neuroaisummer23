# Materials


[Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N8rqa3fcRQgl5CSpL7zRjxPORK5yaw-F?usp=drive_link)

We will use Google Colab to execute the tutorials and code that we will use in the course. To make sure that we can hit the ground running, please complete the following before the start of the course:

* Create a Google Drive folder that you will use for saving all of the course notebooks and materials, and outputs.

* Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and save the intro notebook you will link to (File > Save a copy in Drive) in your course Drive folder.

* Run all of the cells (Runtime > Run all) in the notebook and ‘Print’ the notebook as a PDF. Upload to your personal course Drive Folder. Please reach out to Kevin Tynes (kdtynes@gatech.edu) ASAP if you have difficulty running the notebook or are experiencing very slow runtimes.

* Recommended reading:  You can find additional resources to review on Python Basics and Machine Learning in the course Google Drive folder.
