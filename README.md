# 2023 NeuroAI Summer School
Georgia Tech & Emory University
August 9-11 2023, Atlanta, GA

We will host the first GT/Emory NeuroAI Summer School from Wed Aug 9 - Fri Aug 11, 2023. The workshop will be held at The Hatchery at Emory.

The workshop is targeted to trainees interested in research at the intersection of Neuroscience and ML/AI. The workshop will provide an introduction to deep learning, unsupervised learning, and time series methods, with hands-on coding sessions to get your feet wet. We will also have local (student & faculty) speakers and discussion.

To get the most out of the course, students should have some familiarity with Python programming and machine learning basics (e.g. linear algebra, linear regression).

Selections will be made based on availability (enrollment will be limited 30 students).

This event is organized by Eva Dyer, Chethan Pandarinath, and Anqi Wu, and sponsored by the Georgia Tech/Emory Neural Engineering Center and Computational Neural-Engineering Training Program!
