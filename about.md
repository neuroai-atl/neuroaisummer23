## About

We will host the first GT/Emory NeuroAI Summer School from Wed Aug 9 - Fri Aug 11, 2023. The workshop will be held at The Hatchery at Emory.

The workshop is targeted to trainees interested in research at the intersection of Neuroscience and ML/AI. The workshop will provide an introduction to deep learning, unsupervised learning, and time series methods, with hands-on coding sessions to get your feet wet. We will also have local (student & faculty) speakers and discussion.

This event is organized by Eva Dyer, Chethan Pandarinath, and Anqi Wu, and sponsored by the Georgia Tech/Emory Neural Engineering Center and Computational Neural-Engineering Training Program!
